### Segmentation
- `2015` [U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597)
    - Interesting CNN architecture for image segmentation which involves a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.  Skip connections are introduced to connect the contracting and expanding paths, which allow the network to access both low- and high-level features and preserve spatial information.
